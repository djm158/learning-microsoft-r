# Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R: notes

I've been following along with [this gitbook about microsoft R](https://www.gitbook.com/book/smott/introduction-to-microsoft-r-server/details) and found it contains some really useful information about Microsoft R. However, it doesn't look like the code samples are completely tested and put together completely, so I tried to fix some errors and make them into usable modules (for example, a bash script to download all of the NYC taxi data).
